#What is git ?
Git is a version control system. It helps you keep track of changes made to your files and projects over time. Think of it as a tool that saves every update you make, so you can go back to previous versions or see what changes were made by others.

#what is version contral system?(record changes)
Simple Explanation:
It remembers what changes were made to your codes and when.
If something goes wrong on code, you can return to an earlier version of your code.
It is multiple people uploaded there code and without losing each otherâ€™s code.

#VCS are 3 types LCS, CVCS and DVCS
Local Version Control System (LVC): Tracks changes to code on your local computer.
Centralized Version Control System (CVCS): Stores code and their history on a central server, and users check in or check out code.
Distributed Version Control System (DVCS): Each user has a full copy of the entire repository, including its history (e.g., Git).
